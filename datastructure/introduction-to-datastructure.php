	<h1 class=headcol>Introduction to Datastructure and Algorithms</h1>
</div>
<p class=col-text>Our Datastructure course provide you the indepth knowledge and course is designed for both beginner and professionals.</p>
	<p class=col-text>An overview of data organization and certain data structures will be covered along with a discussion of the different operations which are applied to these data structures.Last, we will introduce the notion of an algorithm and its complexity, and we will discuss the time space tradeoff that may occue in choosing a particular algorithm and datastructure for a given problem.</p>
	<h4 class=headcol>Definition of Datastructure :</h4>
	<p class=col-text>Data may be organized in many different ways; the logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data is called data structure.</p>
	<p class=col-text>The choice of a particular data model depends on two consideration. First, it must be rich enough in structure to mirror the actual relationships of the data in the real world. On the other hand, the structure should be simple enough that one can effectively process the data when necessary. </p>
	<h4 class=headcol>Classification of Datastructures :</h4>
	<p class=col-text>Data structures are generally classified into primitive and non-primitive data structure.Basic data types such as integer,real,character and boolean are known as primitive data structure.These data types consist of characters that cannot be divided, and hence they are also called simple data types.</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>Primitive Data Structures</b>:-Basic data types such as integer,real, character and boolean are known as primitive data structures.</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>Non-Primitive Data Structures</b>:-Linked-lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs are examples of non-primitive data structures.</p>
	<p class=col-text>The simplest example of non-primitive data structure is the processing of complex numbers.Very few computers are capable of doing arithmetic on complex numbers. Linked-lists,stacks, queues, trees and graphs are examples of non primitive data structures.</p>
	<h4 class=headcol>Static and Dynamic Datastructures :</h4>
	<p class=col-text><b>Datastructures also can be classified into two ways:</b></p>
	<p class=col-text><b>1. Static data structure</b>It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed.</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>2. Dynamic data structure</b>It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible.</p>

	<h5 class=headcol>Linear-Datastructure :</h5>
	<p class=col-text>A datastructure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. In linear data structures, the data is arranged in a linear fashion although the way they are stored in memory need not be sequential. Array, linked lists, stacks and queues are example of linear data structures.</p>
	<h5 class=headcol>Non-linear Datastructures :</h5>
	<p class=col-text>A Data structure is said to be non-linear if the data is not arranged in sequence. The insertion and deletion of data is therefore not possible in a linear fashion. Trees and graphs are example of non-linear data structures.</p>
	<h4 class=headcol>Data Structure Operations :</h4>
	<p class=col-text>The data appearing in our data structures are processed by means of certain operations. In fact, the particular data structure that one chooses for a given situation depends largely on the frequency with which specific operations are performed.Let's discuss all the operations one by one.</p>
	<p class=col-text>The following four operations play a major role in this text:</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>1. Traversing :</b> Accessing each record exactly once so that certain items in the record may be processed.(This accessing and processing is sometimes called "visiting" the record</p>
	<p class=col-text ><b>2. Searching :</b> Finding the location of the record with a given key value, or finding the locations of all records which satisfy one or more conditions.</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>3. Inserting: </b>
		Additing a new record to the structure.
	</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>4. Deleting :</b>Removing a record from the structure.</p>
	<p class=col-text>Sometimes two or more of the operations may be used in a given situation;e.g., we may want to delete the record with a given key, which may mean we first need to search for the location of the record.</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>1. Sorting :</b>Arranging the records in some logical order(e.g., alphabetically according to some NAME key, or in numerical order according to some NUMBER key, such as social security number or account number)</p>
	<p class=col-text><b>2. Merging :</b>Combining the records in two different sorted files into a single sorted file.</p>
